/**
 * This exercise is designed to practice the way of working on legacy code base.
 * 
 * Given the following assignment:
 *  As a software developer I want a class, which provides me the possibility
 *  to play the famous "Fizz Buzz" game enhanced with the "Flipp Flopp" game.
 *  I want to give a range of numbers as input and in return I want numbers
 *  following the rules of the games.
 *  
 * The goal is to introduce the new functionality without breaking the existing one.
